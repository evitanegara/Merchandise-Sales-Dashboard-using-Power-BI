Merchandise Sales Analysis Dashboard

📌 Project Background

This project aims to analyze merchandise sales data to uncover key performance trends across product categories, customer demographics, and geographic locations. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help optimize marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer engagement for better business outcomes.

📈 Executive Summary

The merchandise sales analysis covering one year (Nov 2023 to Nov 2024) reveals a total revenue of $856K, with the United States contributing the most ($283K), followed by the United Kingdom ($55K). Clothing is the top-selling category, accounting for approximately 75% of sales. The core customer segment consists of males aged 21–35, contributing significantly to order volume and revenue. Domestic orders dominate shipping volume, but international cities like Sydney and Mumbai have higher average order values, offering a premium revenue opportunity.

📊 Insights Deep-Dive

🗓 Monthly Sales Trend

Merchandise sales totaled $856K over the 12-month period, averaging $66K per month.

May 2024 marked the highest-performing month, generating $81K in revenue, largely fueled by strong Clothing sales ($62K).

In contrast, November 2024 saw a dramatic drop to $10K, suggesting a potential seasonal downturn or missing reporting.

Between February and September, sales remained stable, consistently ranging between $66K–$77K, reflecting reliable mid-year demand.

Throughout the year, Clothing led all categories, contributing 65–75% of monthly revenue and significantly outperforming both Ornaments and Other products.

👕 Key Product Performance

Clothing emerged as the top-performing category, generating $637K from 6.1K units sold, representing nearly 75% of total sales.

Ornaments followed with $156K in revenue from 3.8K units, and Other products generated $63K from 2.5K units.

The top five products by revenue—BF1548 (~$190K), BF1543, BF1550, BF1549, and BF1546—were all from the Clothing category, reinforcing its commercial strength.

Customer sentiment indicates room for improvement: only 60% of reviews were positive, while 25% were negative and 15% neutral, resulting in an average product rating of 3.5.

Among product categories, "Other" items had the highest average rating (3.58), followed by Clothing (3.50) and Ornaments (3.45).

🌍 Geographic Sales Performance

The United States was the top-performing country, generating $283K from 5,139 orders and 8,521 units, largely due to strong demand in cities like San Francisco, New Jersey, and Sacramento.

The United Kingdom followed with $55K in sales, while France reported the lowest revenue at just $8K, signaling underperformance.

Despite lower volume, Sydney recorded the highest city-level sales ($48K), driven by a high AOV of $261 and $18.4K in shipping charges.

San Francisco had the highest domestic order quantity (746 units) and generated $41K in sales with $0 shipping cost, reflecting strong local fulfillment efficiency.

Cities like Mumbai and New Delhi reported solid performance with $38K and $36K in sales respectively, despite higher international shipping fees.

🚚 Shipping Insights

The majority of volume was fulfilled domestically, with 8,521 units shipped, more than double international shipments (3,813 units), reinforcing a strong domestic base.

Domestic shipping is free, which may have helped increase conversion and order frequency.

International orders incur high shipping costs, such as $18.4K in Sydney and $13K in Mumbai, yet these often come with higher-value purchases, evidenced by elevated AOVs.

Across all markets, Clothing remained dominant, with 4.3K units shipped domestically and 1.8K internationally, indicating consistent demand across regions.

Ornaments and Other categories followed the same trend—greater sales volumes domestically than internationally.

🧍 Customer Demographics & Segmentation

🔹 Gender-Based Purchasing Patterns

Male customers were the dominant revenue driver, accounting for ~$600K (around 70% of total sales), while female customers contributed $256K (30%).

The data suggests that either marketing resonates more with male buyers, or they tend to purchase higher-ticket items and bundles.

📊 Age Group Trends

The platform’s core customer base falls in the 21–35 age range, with the highest order volume from:

26–30: 2,057 orders

21–25: 2,046 orders

31–35: 2,018 orders

While younger customers (18–25) show high engagement, older age groups tend to spend more per transaction, especially on higher-value Clothing items.

👕 Product Preferences by Age

Across all age segments, Clothing remains the most preferred category.

Younger buyers (18–25) also purchase Ornaments and Other items at a slightly higher proportion.

Older buyers (26–35) prioritize higher-end Clothing products, contributing more to total revenue.

🏠 City-Level Customer Behavior

The top cities by order volume are:

New Jersey: 434 orders

Portland: 420 orders

San Francisco: 414 orders

These cities contribute significantly to domestic performance, benefiting from free shipping and faster delivery.

In contrast, international cities like Sydney, Mumbai, and New Delhi placed fewer orders, but had a much higher AOV, balancing overall contribution.
